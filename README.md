# Visual-Studio-For-Mac-Modified-Dark-Theme
This is a modified version of the default dark theme with some easy-to-read pastels added.

Some colors may look off; Visual Studio for Mac can't do theme inheritence, apparently,
so I've had to manually add some colors to the list that are placeholders for now.
